## A Robot Motion Planning Project 
## By: Ved Paranjape

##### I implemented my own exact cell decomposition algorithm using plain python without incorporating any 3rd party motion planning libraries. It was implemented using concepts from Computational Geometry for collision checking. For simulation of the environment and for graphics, the python pygame library was used. The following is a summary of the project details and some specifics of the implementation aspects.

## Introduction
# Exact Cell Decomposition divides the workspace into multiple connected units (cells) which are trapezoidal in shape.
